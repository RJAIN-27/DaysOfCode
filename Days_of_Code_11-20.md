#### 11 - 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal - https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

 This question is just like doing a BFS on a graph and now since this is a tree there wont be any cycles, so we do not need a 
 visited array to ensure if cycles are made or not.
 
 Another good thing in the question was how they have managed to make levels for each level of the tree.
